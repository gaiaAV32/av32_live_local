                <h5 class="mag fArial justifiedText">&lsquo;With yoga my brain is too busy thinking about alignment and focusing on my breath to worry about anything else. At the risk of sounding a bit cringe, it helps to keep me present. When I'm home in London I go to vinyasa and yin classes at Stretch in Broadway Market but a friend also introduced me to guru Jagat who runs the RA MA institute in LA and live streams her classes and chats - which I love. Jason Crandell's 25 minute podcasts are great when time is short or I'm travelling.<br />
                <br />
                It can be as simple as setting my alarm for 20 minutes earlier. Most of my working out is done in the crop top and big pants that I slept in and roll out of bed onto the yoga mat in in the morning. I look for clothes that aren't heavily branded but have a bit of style about them; Lisa Marie Fernandez, No Kai Oh and Stella are great. I've also taken to wearing wrap tops and tango skirts from dance shops - you can blame J.Lo in Shall We Dance for that!'</h5>

                <h5 class="mag fArial justifiedText">&lsquo;It's great to start your morning with a sense of achievement, having completed a tough routine. If you plan to work out in the evening you often change your mind, as your friends want to meet for a drink, or you have a last minute meeting. I make sure to stretch before and after every session - it allows me to spend hours at my desk without feeling stiff or getting back pains.<br />
                <br />
                I love to dress for the gym and have a huge selection of wildly printed leggings and sports bras by No Ka Oi, Mara Hoffman and Lucas Hugh, whose founder Anjhe Mules is a perfect brand ambassador - she always looks effortlessly cool. Activewear has to be well fitted and make you feel confident. High-waisted leggings that shape the body are a must - you don't want to give sneak peeks when doing a plank.'</h5>

                <h5 class="mag fArial justifiedText">&lsquo;I started barre a couple of months ago and it's now my primary focus - it's hard, you have to really concentrate, but an hour literally flies by and I've seen results more quickly than with anything else. On a good week I like to take three barre classes and one Barry's. I struggle to self-motivate so going for a run or to the gym on my own doesn't work for me. You have to make it convenient, with minimum effort to get there - finding a class that you like near work that you can do during your lunch break helps.<br />
                <br />I think Gigi Hadid looks great in her exercise gear. I used to wear my boyfriend's T-shirts to exercise in as I love anything oversized, but I've found it's better to wear something slim fitting and I tend to stick to neutral colours. I always envy the stylish girls - there's one at barre who always wears headto- toe Lisa Marie Fernandez&hellip; Chic! I do like to wear my activewear outside of the gym, much to my boyfriend's anguish. It's perfect to change into for a long haul flight.'</h5>

                <h5 class="mag fArial justifiedText">&lsquo;I aim for four workouts a week. I get bored very easily so mixing it up means there is more chance I will stick with it. Running provides me with time to think, yoga to shut off for a bit, and pilates works bits of your body that have probably never been worked out ever. Exercise makes me more productive - it's really important to keep my head clear and focused. I would feel really sluggish - and probably a bit squidgy - if I didn't do anything.<br />
                  <br />
                Early morning is the best so it's out of the way -a 30 minute run is better than nothing if time is short. I listen to a lot of hip hop, '90s house and garage when I run. And as for workout gear - Stella McCartney for Adidas has always been a favourite. I love mesh inserts on leggings, and anything in high shine black fabric. Princess Diana looked great in her workout gear, nowadays Beyonc&eacute;, Rihanna and Victoria Beckham nail it.'</h5>
