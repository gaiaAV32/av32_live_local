        <h5 class="mag fCormorant"><strong>Which came first- the music or the modelling?</strong></h5>
        <h5 class="mag fCormorant justifedText paddedBottom">Music. We started to sing before we started to talk which was the main reason we decided to move to London. But music is super connected to fashion and we’ve always loved it as a beautiful art.</h5>
        <h5 class="mag fCormorant"><strong>Describe The Bloom Twins sound?</strong></h5>
        <h5 class="mag fCormorant justifedText paddedBottom">Our music is ‘Dark pop’- full of dark chords, electronic sounds and melodic, sophisticated vocals. It’s evolved so much because new life experiences inspire us to make songs that feel different but connected to the others ones, like a puzzle to a picture.</h5>

        <h5 class="mag fCormorant justifedText paddedBottom">We can start by creating an electronic keyboard or piano part then layering voices on top. We often change the instrumental parts afterwards to make it even more new and exciting for us.</h5>
