					<p>What's it like being a man flourishing in a womenswear world?
					What I feel is important is the dialogue between a male designer speaking to women. Appreciating, understanding and respecting them.</p>
					 
					<h2>Was that the goal when you started?</h2>
					<p>I always wanted to make beautiful things. To create products that would inspire people and get them excited. But ready-to-wear wasn't my mind-set at the beginning. Have I achieved what I wanted to achieve then vs. now?  No because there is always something new. There is always an evolution.</p>
					 
					<h2>Print in such a powerful medium at the moment. How are you staying ahead of the competition?</h2>
					<p>If you are proud of what you do, your biggest concern is having your own identity, one that people can identify with. [Central Saint Martin's late MA Course Director] Louise Wilson didn't care what aesthetic or taste level it was. What she cared about was whether it looked unique and if it was a language that we had created.</p>
					 
					<h2>What qualities do your prints have?</h2>
					<p>There is always an element of twisted modernity. For me modernity means so many different things. It could be a vintage, William Morris inspired textile that is coloured up in a strange way, a juxtaposition in the colour way, or an ironic twist on the graphic, casual print of an evening wear fabric. There is a consideration for what the print is on, what the print is trying to say and how that print is executed. For PRE SPRING 16 there's a pointillism print that has all the colours in the collection but looks like a texture from a distance.</p>

					<h2>Is print always your starting point?</h2>
					<p>The idea of how we dress comes first.  I start with very broad words: clean, modern, graphic, primary shapes, circles, squares, right angles. Colours you think of - primaries mixed with beiges, that juxtaposition. Then I have to educate those decisions on how those colours are mixed together, which will then determine what fabrics I dye and therefore what the silhouette is in terms of those fabrics. You do some research and you might find a sixties building which has a pattern, or draw inspiration from the way that you work. I am so into simple T-shirt dresses this season. Effortless evening wear like a t shirt</p>

					<h2>How do you make them?</h2>
					<p>Every season it's about research and experimentation, understanding a time period, the type of thing that you want to create. You start with a drawing, you try warping it, or changing it. You look at history and how to make it feel new and modern. All the print designs are done from scratch. That's what's exciting, about creating print designs and working them into garments. A lot of them come from quite craft-orientated techniques - hand sprayed and painted, air brushing on silks and fabrics.</p>

					 					<h2>Where do you find inspiration?</h2>
					<p>Wherever I can. On vacation you are sketching and taking photographs of colours. When you are doing a trunk show in Miami and take an hour out to run down to an exhibition. You do have to chase after it, as opposed to it just happening. Nobody swans off for a month and gets inspired like they did in the seventies. You have to squeeze it in.</p>
					 
					<h2>Do you bounce ideas off the women in your life?</h2>
					<p>I bounce ideas off everybody. I love the dialogue in producing a fashion collection, in creating something, in the understanding of how it makes somebody feel when they wear it. I think the more questions you ask, the better. Every season you are doing something new- you are trying out fabrics you have never tried before [which] react in a totally different way. Experimentation needs refinement.</p>

					<h2>What's your favourite colour</h2>
					<p>I don't have one. What might be my favourite today might be my least favourite next week. [Paying attention to Pantone colours] would be the worst thing that I possibly could do. If you follow the masses, you are screwed. You've got to come up with something that is unique to you.</p>
					 
					<h2>If money was no object, which piece of art would you buy?</h2>
					<p>I would buy a Jackson Pollock because I thought he was an incredible revolutionary at the time. In an ideal world, the first one he ever did when he took his brush off the canvas and he began to use the action of the brush. He was ridiculed for it being frivolous and it not really being art. Now, people appreciate it for how much it pushed things forward. For me to have one of them would be such an incredible thing.</p>
					 
					<h2>Did winning the Vogue Fashion Fund change your brand's directions?</h2>
					<p>I felt like when the Fashion Fund came along, I was starting to get into my groove in terms of understanding my consumer and how to express myself creatively. It was the right time. The Fashion Fund is an incredible thing to happen because not only does it give you money to be able to get the people involved that you need but it also has quite an extensive network of mentors that help you.</p>
					 
					<h2>Finally if you could time travel, which era would you live in?</h2>
					<p>100 years' time. Never look back.</p>
