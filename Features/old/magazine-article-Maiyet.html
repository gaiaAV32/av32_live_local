					<p>A stripped back chair, jaunty easel, dappled black walls – <strong>Maiyet</strong> sets the scene perfectly this season. The arrangement skilfully forcing you to draw a comparison between the master artiste’s studio where the models are found, fidgeting, ready for their portrait to be captured, and the clothes they wear so well. It makes sense too. <strong>Maiyet</strong>’s whole MO is to utilise the increasingly rare skills and knowledge of the finest craftspeople, wherever they might be across the globe. Their art is honed manufacture, a solid understanding of how to make artisanal product by hand. Centuries of know-how passed down through family trees. For instance, <strong>Maiyet</strong>’s cobalt blue sweater is no mass-produced garment, this one is knit in Mongolia using local wool. The accompanying forest green culottes are tailored to within an inch of their life in the USA. Look closer still, and you’ll spot some of the season’s biggest trends explored and mastered within each perfect shot. Here are a few we just spotted... </p>

					<h2>MULES</h2>
					<p> They might be named after a donkey of sorts, but this particular shoe couldn’t be more like a prizewinning racehorse if it tried. These come with hand-painted heels.

					<h2>LEATHER TROUSERS</h2>
					<p> High-waisted, gently flared, with a light sheen – these are the holy grail of any trouser cut from leather, ever.
