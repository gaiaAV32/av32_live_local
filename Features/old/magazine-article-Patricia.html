					<h1 class="mag_title">THE CLOSE UP: PATRICIA CROCKETT</h1>
					<p>As a Director at the London outpost of the esteemed Sprüth Magers gallery, Patricia Crockett is every bit as elegant and intelligent as you’d expect her to be. What she also is, however, is down-to-earth and unflinchingly smiley – proof, if you needed, that the art world isn’t that scary. In a role that takes her all over the world (alongside the numerous art fairs, she’s heading to LA this week for the opening of the new Sprüth Magers gallery, and relocating to Hong Kong soon to head up its first foray into Asia), Crockett remains charmingly grounded. Ahead of the opening of Sprüth Magers London’s new Sterling Ruby exhibition, Crockett sat down to talk with Avenue 32 about making it in the art world, her dream purchases and the importance of talking:

	            <h2>On her career path:</h2>
	            <p>Getting into art wasn’t deliberate. I thought I wanted to study law but realised very quickly that it wasn’t for me, so I read Cultural Science. Then I studied in Bologna and my final thesis was a research project for MOMA. My first job in the art world was at an amazing design and furniture gallery in London. Through a client I then managed to get an interview at Lisson Gallery, where I worked for four and a half years before joining Sprüth Magers just over four years ago. On how to break into the art world: When I got to London I didn’t know anyone, so I just wrote letters to everyone. I think the best way to go about it is to talk, talk, talk to people. I am constantly amazed by how helpful people usually are. On the qualities you need to make it in the art world: Curiosity, flexibility and you need to have great people skills; it’s all about relationships. On what make Sprüth Magers special: One of the first contemporary galleries, it’s also one of the only ones run by a team, two women in fact! Sprüth Magers has always been the leading gallery for representing women artists, including Barbara Kruger, Rosemarie Trockel and Cindy Sherman. We’re also a gallery where the artist always comes first. We can be thoughtful about who we sell to, and sell to people who really love the work.</p>

	            <h2>On what her role as a director involves:</h2>
	            <p>We look after the artists, but I’m a little more focused on sales. I personally do around seven art fairs a year and also look after clients all over the world. We now sell more from the fairs than we do out of the gallery.</p>

				<h2>On her advice to someone who wants to start a collection:</h2>
				<p>I always think buy what you really love and trust your personal taste. I find very personal collections much more interesting. Look around as much as possible, speak to someone in the art world, go to the art fairs, and maybe join one of the patrons’ programs (the one at the Whitechapel Gallery is great!). I truly think the more you learn and compare, the more you establish your own taste. </p>

				<h2>On the best thing about her job:</h2>
				<p>You meet a lot of interesting people. I really love going to work every day. The longer you’re in the art world the better it gets because you create this group of people that you trust, like and think similarly to. </p> 

				<h2>On fashion and art being closer than ever:</h2>
				<p>They are so interlinked. Most of our artists are interested in fashion; Sterling Ruby, for example, has collaborated with Raf Simons and Gary Hume with Stella McCartney. The new Sterling Ruby exhibition at our London gallery is actually a survey of his clothing and textile production, showing the artist’s work wear. Also, to me, a designer like Roksanda is an artist.</p>

			<div class="padded col-6 mob-col-12">
	            <h2>On which piece she would buy if money and access were no object:</h2>
	            <p>Something by Ed Ruscha. I think he’s so great, I absolutely love his work. </p>

				<h2>On her approach to getting dressed for work:</h2>
				<p>It doesn’t vary too much, though maybe I wear a little more colour at fairs; usually you’re at a really boring convention centre so I always feel like you have to. I try to be quite timeless – I always ask myself ‘will I still like this in five years?’ – and have to be comfortable. I’m quite lazy, if a high heel isn’t comfortable, I won’t wear it. Elegant, timeless with a twist – that’s why I really like Victoria Beckham, Roksanda and Barbara Casasola. It’s also important for me that you can dress things up and down.</p>

				<h2>On her person style icon:</h2>
				<p>Karla Otto is incredibly stylish, always effortless. </p> 

				<h2>On five emerging artists to watch:</h2>
				<p>Lydia Gifford, Marieta Chirulescu, Ayan Farah, Lucas Blalock and Lucy Dodd.</p>

				<h2>On her fantasy art/fashion collaboration:</h2>
				<p>Olympia Le Tan and Barbara Kruger.</p>

				<h2>Sterling Ruby’s WORK WEAR: Garment and Textile Archive 2008-2016 is at Sprüth Magers, London from March 10th – April 9th 2016.</h2>
