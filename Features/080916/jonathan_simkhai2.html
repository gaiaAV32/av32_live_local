        <h5 class="mag fArial justifiedText">It can often seem that, despite the myriad trends we encounter each season, how we dress can be roughly divided into two camps: cool/edgy or sexy/pretty. Jonathan Simkhai, however, knows that most of us don&rsquo;t want to choose &ndash; we want it all. So, with his namesake label, Simkhai conjures up collections that are a pitch-perfect balance of the sporty and the sensual, the masculine and the feminine, of uptown polish and downtown ease. You can credit his instinctive understanding of how we want to dress on the fact that Simkhai grew up surrounded by clothes. Aged just 14, he scooped a job in an upstate New York boutique when the owner spotted him helping a friend choose an outfit. He was, he admits, in his element. &ldquo;I always loved shopping, not in a materialistic way but going through the racks with my friend or my mom and seeing them get excited,&rdquo; he tells me when we sit down to talk in his Manhattan showroom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a therapeutic, relaxing moment but also one of confidence&rdquo;.</h5>

        <h5 class="mag fArial justifiedText">Fast-forward to today and Parsons graduate Simkhai is still dressing women &ndash; albeit on a larger scale &ndash; with his eponymous label. That desire to make women feel confident is woven throughout his designs. &ldquo;I think if you dress your best you&rsquo;re setting yourself up for success and power and confidence,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Women want to look in the mirror and feel that they can take on the world.&rdquo; We couldn&rsquo;t agree more, and it seems the rest of the fashion world feels the same. Founded in 2010, last year the brand accelerated from insider secret to the global recognition when Simkhai scooped the Vogue/CFDA Fashion Fund. Despite this momentum and the stamp of approval from industry giants like Anna Wintour, he retains a wide-eyed energy and excitement about what he does - you can still see glints of that 14 year old, enthusing over which jeans his pal should buy. Ask him about what the ethos of his brand is and he&rsquo;ll tell you simply, &ldquo;I make them the things they wish they were wearing&rdquo;. Now, isn&rsquo;t that refreshing? We find out more.</h5>

          <strong>Who?</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;I design for powerful women,&rdquo; Simkhai explains of his muse. Don&rsquo;t try and categorise her further than that, however, as the women who inspire him are a diverse gang, ranging from his mother &ndash; an art-loving jewellery designer &ndash; to friends of his in their twenties and thirties. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really about personality,&rdquo; he affirms. The more recognisable names you&rsquo;ll find in the Simkhai set are an equally varied bunch, from young starlets like Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner (&ldquo;really sweet girls&rdquo;) to sartorial boundary-pushers such as Cate Blanchett (&ldquo;amazing&hellip; such a star&rdquo;).</h5>

          <strong>Why?</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          There&rsquo;s no doubting Simkhai has made himself king of the &lsquo;going out&rsquo; frock (indeed, very specifically, the lacy going out frock). And while his designs do indeed chime with the sassier mood sashaying into fashion at the moment, they can also bring some of this swagger to daywear. The dichotomy between the strong and the delicate at the heart of his aesthetic means Simkhai excels at taking something precious &ldquo;and spinning it so you can wear it with a pair of sneakers and a denim jacket and feel really cool&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine this season&rsquo;s pin stripe, ruffled blouse with a pencil skirt and pointed pumps, of course, but it isn&rsquo;t a stretch to see it with boyfriend jeans and an oversized cardigan either. A dress that makes you feel like a million bucks and you can wear it with sneakers? We can always make room in our wardrobes for that.</h5>

          <strong>What?</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;I like to use a lot of transparent fabrics, embroideries and lace in a nontraditional way, making them a bit more geometric and angular &ndash; or finding a way to turn something gritty and hard into something delicate and beautiful,&rdquo; Simkhai explains. A native New Yorker, he is often influenced by the urban landscape (this season inspired by the work of architect Santiago Calatrava) and spins these cues into striking intarsia knits and angular laces that manage to be at once delicate and tough. There&rsquo;s an unmissable thread of athleticism running throughout his collections; even the most ladylike cocktail dresses have a sporty kick courtesy of racer backs or mesh panels, grounding their sexiness with a relaxed aside. This season, expect to find pieces that encapsulate all these Simkhai signatures: crochet off-theshoulder tops, architectural organza midis, extravagant, flamenco-worthy ruffles and arguably the sexiest little black dress of the season &ndash; a strapless number with a provocatively high slit and shimmy-worthy fringing.</h5>

          Where next? That CFDA accolade (which is short hand in the fashion industry for someone who is about to become A Very Big Deal) might have gone straight to some designers&rsquo; heads, but not Simkhai. &ldquo;I have to pinch myself all the time,&rdquo; he explains of the win. &ldquo;I really want everybody that supported me and gave me a chance, I really want them to be proud and know that they didn&rsquo;t bet on the wrong horse&rdquo;. What he has gained is a new layer of confidence in his brand. The plan for the next few years? Grow Jonathan Simkhai into different categories. When that happens, we&rsquo;ll be very happy indeed &ndash; for now, there will always be room in our wardrobes for another sexy/cool killer dress.</h5>
