            <h3 class="subHeading justifiedText col-6 mob-col-12 centered">Few brands can say that their fabrics are as coveted as their fits and Cary Vaughan and Jenna Wilson of Ace & Jig are revelling in their unique status. The co-founders first bonded over a love of antique textiles and decided to design their own as the basis of their seasonless collections. Since launching in Brooklyn in 2008, fans of Ace & Jig’s dyed yarn creations like Katie Holmes have emerged in force, swayed by the excellent quality and extra special attention to detail paid. Here, Vaughan and Wilson share the secrets to their success.

            <h3 class="subHeading justifiedText col-8 mob-col-12 centered"><strong>Talk us through how you create your fabrics from concept to final collection.</strong><br> We start each season with visuals: little saved cuttings from fabrics and textiles we’ve stumbled upon in our lives and loved. The beginning of planning a collection is always very emotional! Sometimes it’s the weight or hand feel of a dishcloth, or the pattern on an antique lace that turns us on. Every one of our fabrics is woven in India, which makes our process very unique, creative, and mathematical. We plan out each warp and weft in exhausting detail, and work with Indian artisans to create multiple desk looms on antique wooden handlooms before transitioning over to large-scale looms for production. Then we set the fabrics down next to each other, see how they interact, and a colour story starts to emerge. <br> <br> <strong>Where do you source your yarns and decide which ones to use?</strong> All of our yarns are Indian, and most are cotton, with the exception of a bit of lurex or poly to give a fabric a subtle spark or a neon pop. We love starting with cotton because it lends itself to many different styles – tops, bottoms, kaftans and dresses. Cotton is sturdy enough to last, but malleable enough to be made into a lightweight singlecloth (perfect for spring/summer) or a heavyweight doublecloth (for fall/winter).</h3>

            <h3 class="subHeading justifiedText centered col-9 mob-col-12"><strong>What qualities and signatures do you ensure all your fabrics have as you make them?</strong><br> The woven quality of our fabrics is certainly what sets them apart to begin with, but we are also self-proclaimed colour junkies. We love to infuse our designs with unexpected colour and we believe the stripe is an iconic and timeless medium with endless opportunity for reinvention. All of our fabrics include stripes in some way, created by colour or texture or pattern, since we have the loom’s woven framework to provide the boundary. <br><br><strong>Do you make your own samples first?</strong><br>Yes, we make multiple samples of our styles before they are produced on a larger scale. We were lucky enough to stumble upon our Indian manufacturer years ago when we were first starting. They were the only manufacturer we found that could make the type of fabric we had in mind. They live in a cotton hub and have a rich family history of weaving, so our idea excited them as much as it excited us. They are like family to us now. We travel there yearly to visit and work on our newest designs.<br><br><strong> Why do you think your textiles strike such a chord?</strong><br> We like to think our fabrics evoke an emotional response – either some feeling of nostalgia or some sense of history and tradition. And, on a base level, they feel good! Our styles are comfortable and wearable, and can easily transition from day to night or work to the beach. Our customer seems to appreciate this, but also seems invested in our real life story. We do our best to make timeless pieces that last for years and can be mixed and layered and passed on.<br><br><strong>How should we care for Ace & Jig fabrics to ensure their longevity?</strong><br> Many of our fabrics are sturdy enough to toss in the washer and dryer along with everything else. Our more delicate double gauzes or fabrics with metallic threads last best when they are hand-washed or dry cleaned. But live in them! They last, and aren’t susceptible to the trends of each passing season.</h3>
