We always recognise duty-free goods and thresholds ensuring you pay the exact duty required. Avenue 32 will collect this duty at checkout and pay it on your behalf to ensure a swift, uninterrupted customs clearance.</h4>

If you choose to return any items we will refund the full value of these goods to you, excluding duty, and shipping if applicable. For a duty refund, you will need to apply directly to your country's customs and revenue department. You will require a copy of the returns invoice included in your parcel for this process.</h4>
