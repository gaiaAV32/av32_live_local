Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy Goods.  Our acceptance of your Order and the completion of the contract between you and us will take place upon dispatch to you of the Goods ordered and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email on dispatch of your Goods (“Confirmation Email”) and it is at this point that your Card will be debited. Avenue 32 is under no obligations and accepts no liability until the order has been accepted. 

2.2.2 The Contract formed will only relate to those Goods whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Confirmation Email. We will not be obliged to supply any other Goods which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Goods has been confirmed in a separate Email.

2.2.3 We aim to fulfil orders within the delivery period set out in the Confirmation Email, or if no delivery period is specified, then within a reasonable time of the date of the Confirmation Email, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

2.2.4(b) To cancel a Contract, you must inform us in writing and state clearly that you wish to cancel your order under the DSRs. You must also return the Goods to us immediately, in the same condition in which you received them, and at your own cost and risk. You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the Goods while they are in your possession. If you fail to comply with this obligation, we may have a right of action against you for compensation.

2.2.4(c) Avenue32 will not be held liable for insurance of a cancelled purchase against loss or theft.  We advise that you obtain insurance and proof of postage to cover such eventualities.

2.2.4(d) Our free collections service is not available under the DSRs.

2.2.5 Any offers for Goods at discounted prices, including those detailed on the Website, may be made available from time to time for you to order (subject to our acceptance) for a limited period of time.

(i) Prices quoted are correct at time of publishing; and 
(ii) The Goods have been fairly described.
However, please note that we may only accept orders if there are no material errors in the description of the Goods or their prices as advertised on this Website.

2.2.7(a) One or more of the Goods you ordered are unavailable. We will inform you as soon as possible if the Goods you have ordered are not available;

Avenue 32 reserves the right to refuse acceptance of your offer at any time and at our sole discretion and we will not be liable for any instance in which we choose to withdraw your offer in such an event. 

2.2.9 Where any of the Goods contained within an order are out of stock, we will contact you to explain the situation and confirm whether you would like to either cancel the whole order or whether you would like us to process a new order for Goods that we have in stock.

2.2.10 Ownership of the Goods you order on the Website shall pass to you on delivery provided that we have processed and received payment in full for such Goods. Risk of loss or damage to the Goods shall pass to you at the time the Goods are delivered.

2.3. PRICING

2.3.1 The prices stated by us at the time we receive your order are non-negotiable except where we discover an obvious error in the price of the Goods you have ordered as referred to in condition 2.2.6 above. All of the prices shown on this website are in our accepted currencies of pounds sterling (GBP), US dollars (USD) and euros (EUR).

2.3.2 Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Confirmation Email. All product prices are set at the beginning of the season when the items become available on the website. They are therefore subject to currency exchange rates at the time when the price was set. These prices will be subject to change in the event of incremental change in the relevant currency exchange rate or when the items are reduced in price during sale periods.

2.3.3 Our Website contains a large number of Goods and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Goods listed on our Website may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where the correct price of an item is less than our stated price; we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the item to you. If an item’s correct price is higher than the price stated on our Website, we will inform you as soon as possible after receiving your order and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat the order as cancelled.

2.3.4 We are under no obligation to provide Goods to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you a Confirmation Email, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mis-pricing.

2.3.5 All GBP and Euro prices displayed on the Website are inclusive of VAT at the prevailing rate charged in the EU. All prices exclude delivery costs, which will be added to the total amount due, as detailed in condition 5 below.

2.3.6 Prices that are reduced for sales and promotions are only valid for a limited time. We reserve the right to adjust prices, offers, goods and specifications of goods on the Website at our discretion at any time before (but not after) we accept your order.

2.3.7 If you are a customer making an offer to purchase and your credit or debit card is not denominated in GBP, USD or Euros, then the final purchase price will be determined in accordance to the applicable exchange rate at the time when the transaction is processed by your card provider.

2.4. METHOD OF PAYMENT

2.4.1 We will not deduct the price from your Card until payment has been authorised and the Goods are ready to be dispatched. We may delay dispatch until receipt of authorisation for payment to be taken from the Card provided. You can pay using your credit or debit card that either is a VISA, MasterCard, Maestro, Delta, Solo, Visa Electron or American Express card. It is imperative that you provide the cardholder's name as it is shown on the Card, and address exactly as it appears on the Card statement.

2.4.2. All payments processed will be subject to the relevant credit or debit security checks and authorisation by the card issuer.  If your card is not accepted at this stage, Avenue 32 will not be held responsible for non-delivery or late delivery of items.

2.4.3 When you offer to purchase item(s) from the Website and enter your payment details, you agree to confirm that the card belongs to you, and that you are fully authorised to use it. Card fraud is illegal and will lead to prosecution in all cases.

2.4.4 Avenue32 accepts a reasonable duty of care to keep your card details safe and secure when you process a payment.  Avenue32 will not be held liable in the absence of negligence in the event that you incur a loss if a third party obtains access to the details you provide when processing an order from the website.

2.4.5 A payment where you are using a gift card or a promotional code is subject to additional terms and conditions:

2.4.5(a) Avenue32 gift cards are valid for 12 months from the date of purchase;

2.4.5(b) Avenue32 gift cards are redeemable against all or selected products on the website at the website owners’ discretion;

2.4.5(c) If your order total is less than the gift card amount, the remaining credit left on your gift card will be available to you for the remaining period as calculated from the original date that the card was purchased;

2.4.5(d) If your order total is more than the gift card amount, the remaining balance will need to be paid according to the usual terms and conditions. Failure to complete payment of the total balance will result in the entire order being suspended until payment is finalised;

2.4.5(e) If you return items purchased using a gift card, you will be refunded with store credit for the monetary value of the return. A refund in cash or to credit a bank account will not be possible;

2.4.5(f) Virtual gift cards will be sent via email to the intended recipient once payment for the gift card has been completed and authorised. The purchaser will also receive a confirmation email, which should be retained as proof of purchase;

2.4.5(g) Avenue 32 will not be held liable if the recipient’s email is incorrect or invalid. It is the responsibility of the purchaser to ensure that the recipients email is correct;

2.4.5(h) Avenue 32 will not be held liable if the gift card is lost, stolen or destroyed; 

2.4.5(i) Avenue 32 reserves the right to cancel and invalidate a gift card if such action is deemed appropriate. Such action will remain at the discretion of Avenue 32;

2.4.5(j)  Promotional codes cannot be used in order to purchase a gift card; 

2.4.5(k) The usual taxes and customs duties will apply when purchase is made with a gift card.

2.5. DELIVERY

2.5.1 We offer a standard delivery service or an express delivery service.

2.5.2 The standard delivery service usually takes 3 to 5 working days for your Goods to arrive, from receipt of your order.  We make every effort to deliver Goods within the estimated timescales; however delays are occasionally inevitable due to unforeseen factors.  Avenue32 shall be under no liability for any delay or failure to deliver the Goods within the estimated timescales.

2.5.3 If you choose Express Delivery your order will be sent via courier service (signature required) to arrive next working day, if the order is placed before 12pm Monday to Friday (excluding bank holidays and public holidays). Please note that orders placed on a Saturday or Sunday will usually be delivered the following Tuesday. Although we will make every reasonable effort to ensure your products are delivered within the set timescales, unfortunately we cannot guarantee that they will not be affected by unforeseen issues affecting our delivery partner. Under these circumstances, additional delivery charges will not normally be refunded.

2.5.4 Avenue 32 makes use of an integrated duty calculator which calculates precise import duty payable to your country’s customs institutions to ensure a swift passage through to its final destination and ensuring no delays or additional charges are payable by yourselves. This duty is calculated based on a combination of the nature and value of your goods as well as the duty structure of the destination country (outside the EU); recognising at all times duty-free goods and exemptions of the destination country. Should you return your item(s) duties are non-refundable. You may be able to recover these costs by contacting your local customs bureau directly.

2.6. RETURN OF GOODS POLICY

2.6.1 If you wish to return to us any Goods:

2.6.1(a) in respect of which you find a defect within a reasonable time after delivery, we will examine the returned item and, subject to confirmation of the defect by us, we will refund the price of the item.  We will usually process the refund due to you as soon as possible, and in any case, within 30 days of receiving the defective product. You will be refunded in full for the item and also refunded the original delivery charge for us sending the item to you and the cost incurred by you in returning the item to us. Please note that due to Health and Safety at work regulations we require any used faulty goods to be in a clean condition before accepting them for a refund. We reserve the right to refuse Goods which are excessively soiled as they would be rejected by our suppliers.  If we do not agree that there is a defect in Goods you return or if we refuse Goods for being excessively soiled we will notify you by post or email to confirm our justification;

2.6.1(b) because you have cancelled the Contract between us within the seven-day cooling-off period (see condition 2.4 above), once the item has been checked, we will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day you have given notice of your cancellation. In this case, we will refund the price of the item in full, including the cost of sending the item to you. However, you will be responsible for the cost of returning the item to us;

2.6.1(c) for any other reason, you may do so within 28 days of the date of dispatch.[SB13]  Once the item has been checked, we will refund the price of the item, providing it is in a saleable condition and is in its original, undamaged packaging. Please allow up to 21 days from the receipt of your return for a refund to be processed. The delivery charge is non-refundable and, unless otherwise agreed between us, you must pay for the costs of return of the Goods to us. This condition 2.6.1 does not affect your statutory rights.
