            </h4>

All product prices are set at the beginning of the season when the items become available on the website. They are therefore subject to currency exchange rates at the time when the price was set. These prices will be subject to change in the event of incremental change in the relevant currency exchange rate or when the items are reduced in price during sale periods.

If an item’s correct price is higher than the price stated on our Website, we will inform you as soon as possible after receiving your order and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat the order as cancelled.

            <h4 class="static fKarla justifiedText"><strong>2.5.4</strong> Avenue 32 makes use of an integrated duty calculator which calculates precise import duty payable to your country’s customs institutions to ensure a swift passage through to its final destination and ensuring no delays or additional charges are payable by yourselves. This duty is calculated based on a combination of the nature and value of your goods as well as the duty structure of the destination country (outside the EU); recognising at all times duty-free goods and exemptions of the destination country. Should you return your item(s) duties are non-refundable. You may be able to recover these costs by contacting your local customs bureau directly.</h4>
