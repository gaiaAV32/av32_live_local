DO I NEED TO PAY DUTY?

If you are shopping from outside the UK & European Union you may need to pay import duty on your purchases to your country's customs and revenue departments. Avenue 32 makes use of an integrated duty calculator which calculates precise duties payable. This is based on the nature of the goods and how your country treats them as imports. We always recognise duty-free goods and thresholds ensuring you pay the exact duty required. Avenue 32 will collect this duty at checkout and pay it on your behalf to ensure a swift, uninterrupted customs clearance.

IS DUTY REFUNDED IF I RETURN MY GOODS?

When you pay duty at checkout, Avenue 32 pays this duty directly to your country's customs and revenue departments on your behalf. If you choose to return any items we will refund the full value of these goods to you, excluding duty, and shipping if applicable. For a duty refund, you will need to apply directly to your country's customs and revenue department. You will require a copy of the returns invoice included in your parcel for this process.

DO YOU CHARGE FOR GIFT-WRAPPING AND GIFT MESSAGES?

Avenue 32 offer free luxury gift-wrapping and magnetic gift boxes as well as customised gift cards and gift receipts free-of-charge. You also have the option of selecting our discreet eco-friendly packaging which still contains individually tissue-wrapped items.
